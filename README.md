# Berlin_things
This project is about a website called Berlin things, which includes three different pages; the main page called Berlin things, the About Me page and the Login page. This website is the place where people would be able to find things to do in berlin as a tourist. 

My motivation to start this project was to learn all the skills within SE19 like CSS, HTML, Javascript. I learnt those and more things i didnt know about like how a server works through creating this web application.

To access the form linked to the database you have to use /things/new.
